# Some additional reasons to hire Matt Vears.
#
# 1. Definitely a huge fan of Reddit. Several years ago I found /r/programming and I've been coming back in 
#    roughly 15 minute intervals ever since. I love the community and believe I would flourish as an 
#    employee for a company that I care about. 
#
# 2. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax are first nature to me. I know things about obscure IE6 bugs
#    that I wish I could forget.   
#
# 3. I'm comfortable on a Unix system. On Solaris systems, I wrote C and Perl banking apps for four years. 
#	 I'm writing this in vim on my hosts shared server via ssh.
#
# 4. I don't have python experience in a "professional capacity" but I taught myself python when I was 
#    working through the http://projecteuler.net/ problems. I also have Django experience via teaching
#    myself the Google App Engine. So I've worked with distributed key-value stores, as well. 
#
# 5. I've done a little of everything and a lot of development. I love what I do and it shows in my work. I get things done.
#    I am fearless when it comes to learning new technologies and languages. 
#
# 6. Reddit has already changed my life once... A post on /r/quitsmoking/ kicked-started my finally quitting 
#    smoking. (Thank You!)
